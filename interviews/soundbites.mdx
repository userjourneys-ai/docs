title: "Using Soundbites"
description: "Listen to the exact moments users shared feedback with soundbites tied to specific insights."
---

Soundbites are short audio clips capturing the exact moment a user said something relevant. They're automatically extracted and linked to [insights](/interviews/insights) so you can hear feedback in the user's own voice.

## Playing Soundbites

1. Find an insight with a sound icon
2. Click to open the soundbites modal
3. Play individual clips to hear the original audio
4. See the question that prompted the response
5. Read the transcript quote

Each soundbite shows which interview it came from, so you can dig deeper into the full conversation if needed.

## Dubbed Audio

For [non-English interviews](/interviews/languages), soundbites can be dubbed to English so your whole team can understand them.

In the soundbites modal, toggle "Dubbed" to switch between:

- **Original** — The user's actual voice and emotion. Best for understanding tone and authenticity.
- **Dubbed** — AI-generated English translation. Best for sharing with English-speaking teammates who need to understand the content.

<Note>
Dubbed audio is AI-generated speech, not the original user's voice. Toggle to original when you want to hear genuine emotion and inflection.
</Note>

## Why Soundbites Matter

Reading "users find onboarding confusing" hits differently than hearing a frustrated user say "I had no idea what to do next, I almost gave up." Soundbites capture:

- **Emotion** — Frustration, excitement, confusion, delight
- **Emphasis** — What users stress as important
- **Authenticity** — Real voices are more compelling than summaries
