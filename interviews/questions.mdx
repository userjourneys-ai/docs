Questions in interviews are conversation goals, not scripts. The AI uses them as topics to explore but won't read them verbatim. This means how you write questions matters for getting useful feedback.

## Write Open-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions invite detailed responses and give users room to share their genuine experience.

**Good questions:**
- "What made you decide to try our product?"
- "What was confusing about getting started?"
- "What's one thing we could improve?"
- "How do you typically use this feature?"

**Avoid yes/no questions:**

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Did you like the onboarding?" | "How did you feel about the onboarding experience?" |
| "Was the pricing clear?" | "What was your reaction to our pricing?" |
| "Is the product easy to use?" | "Walk me through how you use the product day-to-day." |

## Question Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Aim for 5-7 questions">
    This gives enough depth for meaningful insights without making interviews too long. Users typically spend 5-10 minutes in an interview.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Order matters">
    The AI follows your question sequence but will skip questions if the user already addressed them naturally. Put your most important questions early in case the conversation runs long.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific about what you want to learn">
    Instead of "What do you think about our product?" try "What problem were you trying to solve when you found us?" The more focused your question, the more actionable the feedback.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Think about what decisions you're trying to make, then write questions that would give you the information to make them.

## Next Steps

Once you've written your questions, [create an experiment](/interviews/experiments) to start collecting feedback.
