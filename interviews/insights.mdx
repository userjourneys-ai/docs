title: "Understanding Insights"
description: "Learn how insights are extracted from interviews and how to use them to improve your product."

Insights are patterns and themes automatically extracted across multiple interviews. Rather than reviewing each interview individually, insights surface what matters most.

## When Insights Appear

Insights need enough data to identify patterns. **You'll need 3-5 completed interviews** before meaningful insights emerge.

Once you have enough interviews:
- Insights generate automatically
- They regenerate as new interviews come in
- No manual action needed on your part

<Note>
If you're not seeing insights yet, check how many successful interviews you have. Interviews marked as [unsuccessful](/interviews/quality) don't count toward insight generation.

## Insight Components

### Key Insights

Themes identified across interviews, each tagged with sentiment:

| Color | Sentiment | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Green | Positive | Users expressed satisfaction or praise |
| Red | Negative | Users expressed frustration or criticism |
| Gray | Neutral | Observation without strong sentiment |

### User Suggestions

Feature requests and improvement ideas mentioned by users. These are specific asks rather than general themes—things like "I wish I could export to PDF" or "it would help to have keyboard shortcuts."

### Competitors Mentioned

Other products users referenced during interviews. Useful for understanding your competitive landscape and what alternatives users have tried or considered.

## Using Insights Effectively

**Prioritize by sentiment.** Red (negative) insights often point to friction worth fixing. Green (positive) insights show what to preserve—don't accidentally break what users love.

**Listen to the source.** Click any insight with a sound icon to hear the original [soundbites](/interviews/soundbites)—the exact moments users said something relevant. Hearing tone and emotion adds context that text alone can't capture.

**Watch for patterns over time.** As more interviews complete, insights become more reliable. A theme mentioned by one user might be an outlier; the same theme from ten users is a signal.

<Tip>
Share insights with your team by playing soundbites in meetings. Hearing real users describe their experience is more compelling than summarizing it yourself.
