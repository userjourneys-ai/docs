An experiment is a configured interview that you share with users. Each experiment has its own [questions](/interviews/questions), settings, and collected responses.

## Required Fields

### Experiment Name

Internal identifier for your experiment. This is not shown to users—use it to organize your interviews.

**Examples:** "Onboarding Feedback Q1", "Churn Exit Interview", "Power User Research"

## Optional Fields

### Product Context

Background information about your product that helps the AI ask relevant follow-up questions. The more context you provide, the better the AI can probe for specifics.

Include:
- What your product does
- Target audience
- Key features
- Pricing model
- Common use cases

<Tip>
You can paste text directly or enter a URL to auto-extract product information from your website.
</Tip>

### First Message

Customize how the AI greets users. Supports these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Replaced With |
|-------------|---------------|
| `{name}` | Interviewer name |
| `{product}` | Product name from project settings |
| `{question}` | First interview question |

**Example:**
```
Hey! I'm {name}. Thanks for joining—this will only take a few minutes. Let's start: {question}
```

### Interviewer Name

What the AI introduces itself as. Defaults to "Alex" if not specified.

### Interview Reward

Text shown to users after they complete the interview. Use this for thank you messages or reward codes.

**Example:**
```
Thanks for your feedback! Here's 20% off your next purchase: FEEDBACK20
```

## Managing Experiments

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Edit** | Changes apply to new interviews only. Existing responses aren't affected. |
| **Pause** | Stop accepting new responses. Existing data remains accessible. |
| **Delete** | Removes the experiment configuration. Interview data is preserved. |
| **Copy Link** | Production URL for sharing with real users. |
| **Copy Test Link** | Test mode URL that doesn't count toward usage limits. |

<Warning>
Editing an experiment doesn't retroactively change completed interviews. If you significantly change your questions, consider creating a new experiment instead.
</Warning>
