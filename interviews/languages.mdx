## Translation Toggle

When viewing non-English interviews:
- **Default:** Shows English translation
- **Toggle:** Switch to see the original language

This lets you verify translations or review with team members who speak the original language.

## Dubbed Soundbites

[Soundbites](/interviews/soundbites) from non-English interviews can be [dubbed to English](/interviews/soundbites#dubbed-audio). This generates AI-spoken audio of the translated text, making it easy to share feedback clips with English-speaking teammates.

<Note>
Dubbed audio is AI-generated. Toggle to the original to hear the user's actual voice and emotional tone.
