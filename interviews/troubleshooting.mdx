## No insights appearing

[Insights](/interviews/insights) require multiple completed interviews to identify patterns. You'll need 3-5 successful interviews before insights generate. They appear automatically—no action needed on your part.

## Microphone permission denied

Users must grant microphone access to participate in interviews. If permission was denied:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open browser settings">
    Click the lock or info icon in the browser address bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find microphone permission">
    Look for "Microphone" in the site permissions list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set to Allow">
    Change the permission from "Block" to "Allow".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload the page">
    Refresh to apply the new permission.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## User can't start interview

Check these common causes:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Experiment paused | Resume the experiment from your dashboard |
| Usage limit reached | Upgrade plan or wait for limit reset |
| Microphone denied | Follow steps above to grant permission |
| Unsupported browser | Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge |

## Audio not playing

If [soundbites](/interviews/soundbites) or interview audio won't play:

- Check browser audio permissions for the site
- Try a different browser
- Note: Some failed interviews may not have audio available

## Interview marked "Poor quality"

The system determined the feedback wasn't useful for insights. Common causes:

- Very short conversation (under 2 minutes)
- Off-topic discussion
- One-word answers throughout

Toggle "Show all responses" in the experiment dropdown to see the transcript and understand why. See [Quality Evaluation](/interviews/quality) for more details.
