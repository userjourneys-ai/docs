### Create your auth token and configure Sentry

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Sentry auth tokens">
  Go to your Sentry auth tokens page.

{" "}

<a
  href="https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer"
>
  sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
</a>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new auth token with read scopes">
  Click <strong>Create New Token</strong>, give it a descriptive name (e.g., <em>userjourneys-read</em>), and enable <strong>read</strong> permission on the following scopes:

- Project
- Issue & Event
- Organization

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why these scopes are needed">
    - <strong>READ • Project</strong>: Resolve project metadata for mapping issues and replays.
    - <strong>READ • Issue & Event</strong>: Fetch issues and event details to enrich timelines.
    - <strong>READ • Organization</strong>: Identify your org context and list projects safely.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Copy your auth token">Copy the generated token.</Step>

<Step title="Find your Sentry Organization ID (slug)">
  Your Organization ID is the org <em>slug</em> shown in Sentry.

- Go to <a href="https://sentry.io/settings/organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sentry.io/settings/organization/</a>.
- Copy the <strong>Organization Slug</strong> value (e.g., <code>acme-corp</code>).

```text
Settings → Organization → General → Organization Slug
```

{" "}

<Tip>
  The organization also appears in the URL. For example, if you use{" "}
  <code>https://myorganization.sentry.io</code>, then the slug is{" "}
  <code>myorganization</code>.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step title="Find your Sentry Project ID">
  You can obtain the numeric Project ID from Project Settings.

- In Sentry, open the target <strong>Project</strong>.
- Go to <strong>Project Settings → General</strong> and locate the <strong>Project ID</strong> field.
- Copy the numeric Project ID (not the slug).

```text
Project ID: 4510006031155281
```
