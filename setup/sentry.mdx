### Create your auth token and configure Sentry

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Sentry auth tokens">
  Go to your Sentry auth tokens page.

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sentry Cloud (sentry.io)">
    <a href="https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/</a>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    Replace <code>YOUR_SENTRY_BASE_URL</code> with your instance domain:

```text
https://YOUR_SENTRY_BASE_URL/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
```

  </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  <Info>
  You create a personal auth token from your Sentry user account. It grants read access for this integration only.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a new auth token with read scopes">
  Click <strong>Create New Token</strong>, give it a descriptive name (e.g., <em>userjourneys-read</em>), and enable <strong>read</strong> permission on the following scopes:

- Project
- Issue & Event
- Organization

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why these scopes are needed">
    - <strong>READ • Project</strong>: Resolve project metadata for mapping issues and replays.
    - <strong>READ • Issue & Event</strong>: Fetch issues and event details to enrich timelines.
    - <strong>READ • Organization</strong>: Identify your org context and list projects safely.
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Copy and paste your auth token">
  Copy the generated token and paste it into your [project settings](https://app.userjourneys.ai/settings).

  <ParamField body="Sentry Auth Token" type="string" required>
  Personal auth token with read scopes: Project, Issue & Event, Organization.
  </ParamField>
</Step>

<Step title="Find your Sentry Organization ID (slug)">
  Your Organization ID is the org <em>slug</em> shown in Sentry.

- Go to <strong>Organization Settings</strong> in Sentry.
- Copy the <strong>Organization slug</strong> (e.g., <code>acme-corp</code>).

```text
Example URL: https://sentry.io/organizations/acme-corp/
Org ID (slug): acme-corp
```

Paste it into your [project settings](https://app.userjourneys.ai/settings).

  <ParamField body="Sentry Org ID" type="string" required>
  Your Sentry organization slug (e.g., <code>acme-corp</code>).
  </ParamField>
</Step>

<Step title="Find your Sentry Project ID">
  You can obtain the numeric Project ID from Project Settings.

- In Sentry, open the target <strong>Project</strong>.
- Go to <strong>Project Settings → General</strong> and locate the <strong>ID</strong> field.
- Copy the numeric Project ID (not the slug).

```text
Project slug: web-frontend
Project ID: 12345678
```

Paste it into your [project settings](https://app.userjourneys.ai/settings).

{" "}

<ParamField body="Sentry Project ID" type="string" required>
  Numeric project identifier from Sentry (e.g., <code>12345678</code>).
</ParamField>

  <Tip>
  If you only see a slug, open Project Settings → General. The numeric ID appears in the header section and in API examples.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Set your Sentry Instance URL (if self-hosted)">
  If you use self-hosted Sentry, enter your base URL. If you use Sentry Cloud, leave this field empty and we default to <code>https://sentry.io</code>.

```text
Examples:
SaaS (default): https://sentry.io
Self-hosted:     https://sentry.acme.internal
```

  <ParamField body="Sentry Instance URL" type="string">
  Base URL of your Sentry instance. Leave empty for Sentry Cloud.
  </ParamField>
