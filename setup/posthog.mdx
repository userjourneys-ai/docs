<Step title="Set access permissions">
  Ensure the key has the following permissions:

  - <strong>WRITE</strong> access: Action, Sharing configuration
  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do we do with this access?">
    - <strong>READ • Person</strong>: Link session replays to users to analyze user journeys over time.
    - <strong>READ • Query</strong>: Compute aggregates (affected users, first/last seen, paths) to prioritize tickets.
    - <strong>READ • Session recording</strong>: Retrieve replays and their metadata.
    - <strong>WRITE • Action</strong>: Create actions to automatically detect flows (e.g., onboarding). We use these to analyze issues at each step of a flow.
    - <strong>WRITE • Sharing configuration</strong>: Generate shareable links to tickets and replay snippets for your team.
