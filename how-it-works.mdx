<Step title="AI identifies friction">
  Our models watch your replays to find where users are confused, stuck or giving up. 
  
  For example:
    - Long time spent on a page, modal, component
    - Abandonments at critical steps (checkout, login, onboarding) and the why behind them
    - Users getting stuck in navigation loops and dead-ends
    - bugs and errors that block users from completing their journey
  
</Step>

<Step title="Tickets are generated and prioritized">
  Quickly identify the high impact issues.
  | Title | Priority | Affected Users |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Onboarding search fails to find companies, users abandon | High | 77 |
  | User can accidentally remove their own access | Medium | 2 |
  | File upload failure shows a generic error | Low | 20 |

</Step>

<Step title="Double check the details">
  Under each ticket you will find every replay where the issue occurred along with a more detailed description and reproduction steps.

  <Tip>
  Quickly scan the replay by clicking through the reproduction steps.

<Step title="Triage the ticket">
    if the issue is important and should be fixed, you can "Accept" it and optionally copy it to your project management tool. We also have a "Copy Prompt" button if you want to use AI to fix the issue immediately.
    Otherwise, you can "Reject" it and the issue will be ignored.
